			<h1>My Teaching Philosophy</h1>
			<p style="margin-top: 10px">I believe that a child must be in a safe, secure environment in order to learn.  This includes being sensitive to students’ needs and caring for each and every individual in my class.  As a teacher, you must care about your students learning experiences.  I will be aware of my students’ sensitivities, strengths, weaknesses, and personalities.  Once this information is gained, the teaching environment will be much more conducive to learning.</p>
			<p>I believe that all children and their parents should be satisfied with their schooling.  Curriculum will be as rigorous as the child can handle in order to encourage him or her to reach their highest potential.  Each student will have curriculum modifications and/or accommodations unique to them individually.  All students have a right to be challenged through their daily educational experiences in school.</p>
			<p>I will provide support for all students that would benefit for them.  I will include individualized education programs, curricular adaptations, instruction in social skills or self-management, class arrangement, creative scheduling, assistive technology, and other additional supports to help my students succeed to the best of their ability.</p>
			<p class="chalk">I will ensure families that their child will be included in the least restrictive environment as possible for their particular needs.  The child will be included in an inclusive environment as deemed appropriate for their specific situation.  The amount of time spent in an inclusive setting will range from having specials (music, art, and physical education), lunch, and/or recess with students in general education, to be included full time with supports necessary for the specific student.</p>
